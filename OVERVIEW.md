## Overview

  

This repository houses AMExplorer, an innovative tool for generating datasets. Through the integration of metadata from different sources, such as AndroGuard, which makes it possible to extract information such as application names, permissions and API calls, along with obtaining data from APKs from AndroZoo and scan reports from VirusTotal, this tool produces three distinct types of datasets. These sets encompass comprehensive metadata about applications, binary and discrete information, all built to be used in a variety of contexts, from machine learning enhancement to malware analysis.
